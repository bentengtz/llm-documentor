- **Report Generated**: 2025-08-24 23:29:30
- **Total Risks Identified**: 2
- **ISO 14971 Compliance**: Yes

## Executive Summary

This risk management report has been prepared in accordance with ISO 14971:2019 
"Medical devices â€” Application of risk management to medical devices". The report 
documents the systematic risk analysis performed on the medical device software.

### Risk Summary
- **High Priority Risks (Unacceptable)**: 0
- **Medium Priority Risks (Undesirable)**: 1
- **Low Priority Risks (Acceptable/Negligible)**: 1
- **Average Risk Score**: 7.50

### Severity Distribution
- **Serious**: 2 risks

### Probability Distribution
- **Medium**: 1 risks
- **Low**: 1 risks

## Detailed Risk Analysis

The following risks have been identified through systematic analysis of the software requirements:

### Risk 1: RISK_0001

**Hazard**: Incorrect patient data processing

**Cause**: Invalid input data bypassing validation or processing errors in data handling logic

**Effect**: Incorrect patient information leading to misdiagnosis, wrong treatment decisions, or medication errors

**Initial Risk Assessment**:
- Severity: Serious
- Probability: Medium
- Risk Level: Undesirable
- Risk Score: 9
- Priority: 2

**Risk Control Measures**:
Implement data integrity checks and validation for invalid input data bypassing validation or processing errors in data handling logic. Add data backup and recovery mechanisms.

**Individual Control Measures**:
1. Implement data integrity checks and validation for invalid input data bypassing validation or processing errors in data handling logic. Add data backup and recovery mechanisms.

**Verification of Risk Control**:
Comprehensive testing including unit, integration, and system tests. Data validation testing and integrity checks.

**Risk Control Effectiveness**: 0.80

**Residual Risk Assessment**:
- Residual Severity: Negligible
- Residual Probability: Remote
- Residual Risk Level: Negligible

**Risk Acceptability**: Acceptable

**Risk-Benefit Analysis**: 
Risk is acceptable only with proper risk control measures in place. Clinical benefits justify the residual risk when controls are effective. Risk-benefit ratio is favorable with implemented mitigations.

**Post-Market Surveillance Plan**:
Quarterly monitoring of risk control measures. Semi-annual review of incident reports. Annual risk assessment update.

**Action Required**: Risk control measures recommended

**Related Requirements**: SR_001

### Risk 2: RISK_0002

**Hazard**: Delayed or missing vital signs display

**Cause**: System performance issues, network delays, or display refresh failures

**Effect**: Healthcare providers may miss critical changes in patient condition, leading to delayed intervention

**Initial Risk Assessment**:
- Severity: Serious
- Probability: Low
- Risk Level: Acceptable
- Risk Score: 6
- Priority: 3

**Risk Control Measures**:
Implement comprehensive safety measures to prevent system performance issues, network delays, or display refresh failures. Add monitoring and automatic shutdown capabilities.

**Individual Control Measures**:
1. Implement comprehensive safety measures to prevent system performance issues, network delays, or display refresh failures. Add monitoring and automatic shutdown capabilities.

**Verification of Risk Control**:
Comprehensive testing including unit, integration, and system tests

**Risk Control Effectiveness**: 0.80

**Residual Risk Assessment**:
- Residual Severity: Negligible
- Residual Probability: Remote
- Residual Risk Level: Negligible

**Risk Acceptability**: Acceptable

**Risk-Benefit Analysis**: 
Risk is acceptable with current control measures. Clinical benefits clearly outweigh the minimal residual risk. Risk-benefit analysis supports market approval.

**Post-Market Surveillance Plan**:
Annual review of risk status and control measure effectiveness. Monitor through routine post-market surveillance activities.

**Action Required**: Risk control measures may be considered

**Related Requirements**: SR_004

## Risk Management Conclusion

This risk analysis has identified 2 potential risks associated with the medical device software. 
All risks have been assessed according to ISO 14971 principles and appropriate risk control measures have been proposed.

### Risk Acceptability Summary
- **Unacceptable Risks**: 0 (require immediate action)
- **Undesirable Risks**: 1 (require risk control measures)
- **Acceptable Risks**: 1 (may require monitoring)

### Recommendations
1. Implement all proposed risk control measures for unacceptable and undesirable risks
2. Verify effectiveness of risk control measures through testing and validation
3. Monitor residual risks throughout the product lifecycle
4. Review and update risk analysis when design changes occur
